Overwrite functionality: 

UserStory: As a user, I can overwrite the trasactional data so that I can overwrite the correct data. 

Workflow: 
1. Insert the unique constraint to the Weight Ticket column. Delete all the duplicate entries for that column and insert the "UNIQUE CONSTRAINT"
for the weight ticket column. 

    -> UNIQUE CONSTRAINT does NOT allow any duplicate entries to be inserted in the column as a trasactional data. 

    SQL Syntax:
    ALTER TABLE INBOUND
    ADD CONSTRAINT unique_contstraint_name UNIQUE inbound_weight_ticket

2. API endpoint will throw the SQL Exception if a user tried to insert the duplicate data. This Exceptionc can be caught either at the backend
API using springboot OR at front end at React API call [Within the async method to call API]

3. Catch the SQL Exception at the React js front using the response error code between 400 and 600.
